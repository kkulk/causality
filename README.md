# Causal Discovery with Rare Events

This is a repository for the paper "Towards Dynamic Causal Discovery with Rare Events: A Nonparametric Conditional Independence Test" by Chih-Yuan Chiu, Kshitij Kulkarni, and Shankar Sastry, presented at the [Conference on Decision and Control, 2023](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10383747).

You can find code for both the synthetic data experiments and for experiments on real data collected from the Caltrans PeMS dataset. The single and multi-dimensional synthetic experiments can be found in ```synthetic_data```. The experiments with real data can be found in the files ```Traffic-Accidents-Route-FREEWAY_NAME.ipynb```.

The datasets used in the experiments can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vJYBNLZ_4hya4NiQ3mvHfKAfZMr5YHcE?usp=share_link
